SwiftClip – Design & Branding Blueprint
1. Brand Identity
Name & Tagline

Name: SwiftClip

Tagline: “Your clipboard, smarter and faster.”

Minimal & Modern: Clean, sleek, avoids clutter.

Trustworthy & Private: Security-first, local-first by default.

Friendly & Approachable: Human-readable language, small visual touches that delight (subtle animations, smooth transitions).

Tone of Voice

Short, direct, friendly.

Examples:

Onboarding: “Let’s make your clipboard work smarter.”

Pinning an item: “Pinned for easy access.”

Privacy notice: “Sensitive content stays private.”

Subtle shadows for depth (floating panel effect).

Smooth fade/slide transitions, cursor-proximal animations.

3. UI/UX Design Principles
Core Design Goals

Instant Recognition – users know what each element does at a glance.

Non-Intrusive – panel appears near cursor, doesn’t disrupt flow.

Quick Navigation – keyboard-first experience, arrow keys, Enter/⌘ shortcuts.

Context-Aware – automatically hides sensitive content from certain apps.

Consistency – macOS-native patterns (touch bar hints, haptic feedback, dark/light modes).

Key Components

Floating Panel    Main UI showing clipboard history    Cursor-proximal, max height ~60% of screen
Search Bar    Quick filter of items    Instant results as you type
Item Cards    Clipboard snippet preview    Text, image, or file icon; hover reveals actions
Pinned Section    Fixed top area for pinned items    Visual separation via color/line

Onboarding Screens    Permissions, shortcut setup, privacy settings    Full-screen modal, swipable for tutorial flow
4. Interaction & Animation
